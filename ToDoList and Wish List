Highest Priority things to add:
  *Averaged updating bias function--Done!

Highest Priority things to test:

In the future, it'd be cool to add:
  *specific function to state population distribution (very quick to add)
  *Volubility attribute
  *Topics variable
  *Spatiality in conversations
  *Accuracy of one's gaze (that is, gazing correctly at the individual who did talk) should alter gaze behavior in the future. 
    *Q learning or Reinforcement learning

In the future, it'd be cool to test:
* Having unequally distributed races/genders should be enough to produce runaway inequality, regardless of bias level 
    (since fewer speakers of that level, fewer bias updates, fewer people look at them, etc etc.)
   *Whether speaker's gaze is more strongly influential than non-speakers gaze.
